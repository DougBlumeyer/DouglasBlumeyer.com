This is a basic Rails app I built, powering my personal homepage.

Nothing fancy:
* jQuery animation for my logo
* modal form + Ajax requests + ActionMailer for the webform
* (there is a bare bones backend for storing the webforms as well)
* Frankenstein monster of some free Bootstrap templates I found
